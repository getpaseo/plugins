Antigravity CLI adds **Antigravity** as a Paseo agent provider. Each Paseo session runs Google's `agy` command in its `stream-json` mode, so the work happens in the `agy` already installed and signed in on the daemon machine, and Paseo shows its turns, tool calls, and edits. Described for `agy` 1.2.9 to 1.2.16, Paseo 0.9.1 or later on daemon and app, and Node 24 for the plugin process.

## Setup

`agy` must be installed and signed in on the daemon machine. Pick **Antigravity** when you start an agent. The plugin's own code makes no network requests, and it does not read or write `agy`'s stored sign-in.

## Permissions and modes

- **Tool approval** is decided by `agy` from its own `toolPermission` setting. Paseo cannot show approval prompts. A session setting can skip all permissions with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`.
- **Plan mode** is an instruction the plugin adds to the model's prompt (investigate read-only, end with a plan). It is not a sandbox, and a model that ignores it can still write files. The **Sandbox** setting passes `--sandbox`, which the plugin's notes say did not stop a write outside the workspace in testing.
- **Steering is not supported.** A slash command, a skill, or a structured-output prompt sent while a turn is running is refused until the turn finishes. A plain message is also refused if the running turn used one of those.

## Shared MCP servers (off by default)

With **Share Paseo tools with Antigravity** on, the plugin writes Paseo's MCP servers into `<working directory>/.agents/mcp_config.json` as `paseo-<name>` entries. Those entries contain the servers' credentials. In a git work tree the plugin adds the file to the repository's `.git/info/exclude`, not `.gitignore`. Outside a git work tree, keep the file out of commits yourself. When the last session there closes, it removes its own entries and deletes the file only if it created it.

## Multiple accounts (optional)

The default account is the sign-in `agy` already has. You can add accounts from the **Antigravity accounts** page, and new agents use the active one. Each added account is a separate home directory under the plugin's data folder:

- Its top-level entries are symlinks into your real home directory, and `~/.gemini/config` (MCP servers, plugins, skills) is shared by link. The first launch of a new account may add plugin entries to the shared `~/.gemini/config/config.json`, the same file the default account already writes. It keeps its own `agy` history and a copy of `settings.json`.
- On macOS it gets its own keychain with an empty password, set as that home's default and unlocked before each launch, and `agy` stores that account's sign-in there. The plugin does not read it.
- Adding an account opens `agy`'s sign-in, in a Terminal window on the daemon machine on macOS or as a command to run elsewhere. Removing an account deletes its home directory, including its sign-in and history, and not your real home. Windows supports only the default account.
- The page shows each account's quota by running `agy -p /usage` under that account when you open or refresh it.

## Files

Under the Paseo home directory in `plugin-data/antigravity-cli/`: saved conversation timelines, temporary attachments and schema files for a session, the account list, and account homes. The plugin reads each account's `agy` settings, conversation index, and subagent transcripts.

## Limits

- Edit diffs are reconstructed from file snapshots and may be missing.
- Subagent sessions are read-only and depend on `agy`'s undocumented transcript format.
- Imported conversations resume but earlier turns are not replayed.
